# ðŸ§  DSA Pattern Notebook

Welcome to the **DSA Pattern Notebook** â€” a personal, structured repository to **internalize algorithmic patterns**, practice **brute-to-optimal thinking**, and **revise quickly before interviews** at top tech companies like Google, Meta, Amazon, etc.

This is not a solution bank. Instead, itâ€™s a **revision-first knowledge base** designed to:

- Recognize and master common DSA patterns
- Understand brute force and optimized solutions
- Capture key takeaways and edge cases
- Build lasting intuition, not just memorization

---

## ðŸ“š Repository Structure

The repository is organized by **core DSA patterns and problem-solving techniques**, such as Sliding Window, Binary Search, Graphs, etc.

## ðŸ§© Folder Naming Convention

Each top-level folder (e.g., `01-sliding-window`) represents a **problem-solving pattern** or algorithmic concept.

## ðŸ“„ File Types Explained

### 1. `pattern.md`
This file explains the **core idea of the pattern**. It includes:

- When and why the pattern applies
- Typical problem structures
- Implementation tricks and pitfalls
- Common variations or extensions
- Links to foundational problems

âœ… Think of this as the **"what, why, when"** of the pattern.

### 2. `summary.md`
This is a **concise review sheet** for rapid revision. It includes:

- Pattern checklist
- Time/space complexity heuristics
- Debugging tips
- Edge case watch-outs
- Short notes on related patterns

âœ… Perfect for a **10-minute review** the night before an interview.
