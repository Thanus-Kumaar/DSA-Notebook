# 🏷️ Pattern & Concept Index (Tag Directory)

Welcome to the **Tag Index** — a centralized list of all major **DSA patterns**, **algorithmic strategies**, and **concepts** used across this repo.

Use this as your **quick-access dashboard** before interviews to jump to key folders or revise specific ideas.

### 🧮 01. Hashing

- 📁 [`01-hashing`](01-hashing)
- ✅ Common Uses:
  - Frequency counting
  - Duplicate detection
  - Prefix sums with lookup
  - Pattern recognition (e.g., anagram detection)
- 🔗 Related Concepts: Sliding Window, Prefix Sum, Sets, Maps

---

### 👣 02. Two Pointers

- 📁 [`02-two-pointers`](02-two-pointers)
- ✅ Common Uses:
  - Sorted array traversal
  - In-place array problems
  - Start–end merging logic
  - Fast & slow pointer cycles (Floyd’s algorithm)
- 🔗 Related Concepts: Sliding Window, Linked Lists, Binary Search

---

## 🧰 Miscellaneous Patterns (In Progress)

- Monotonic Stack / Queue
- Trie (Prefix Tree)
- Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)
- Topological Sort
- Flood Fill
- Prefix Sum / Difference Array
- Math Tricks (GCD, MOD, Primes)

📁 These are located in respective pattern folders or will be grouped under [`13-misc/`](X-misc) when unclassified.

## 🧭 Navigation Tips

- 🧩 Each pattern folder contains:
  - `pattern.md` → theory and concept
  - `summary.md` → cheat sheet for fast revision

---

## 📎 Suggested Use

- Before interviews: Open this file, jump to the pattern you feel rusty in.
- During learning: Tag problems with multiple patterns if needed.
- While reviewing: Look for takeaways or variations that cross pattern boundaries.

---

🎯 Focus on **understanding transitions** from brute-force → optimal → pattern recognition → generalization.

Happy pattern hunting!
